## notes

As part of configuration, share the Google Sheet used with `gloss-728@auth-project-189019.iam.gserviceaccount.com` which was configured [here]()

## new project notes

There are 3 files for env vars:

- .env
  - These are used during the commands deploy script
- wrangler.toml
  - Unsure if these are used locally, they are used in production and must be present. Secrets live in the web UI under settings for a worker.
- .dev.vars
  - These are used locally

[Set up a new service account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=auth-project-189019&supportedpurview=project), then in account settings, download a new key. Update the values in `google-auth.ts`, and include the private key in `.dev.vars`.
