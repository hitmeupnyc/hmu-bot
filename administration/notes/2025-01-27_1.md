# Project Setup Progress - 2025-01-27

## Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] Database schema design with MVP focus
- [x] Third-party API research (Eventbrite, Patreon, Klaviyo)  
- [x] Sync service architecture documentation
- [x] Node.js/TypeScript backend setup
- [x] React/TypeScript frontend setup
- [x] Docker configuration with compose
- [x] Basic project structure and routing
- [x] Core services (Database, Member, Event, Webhook)
- [x] Basic UI layout with Tailwind CSS

## Current Status
- Backend: Core services implemented, ready for database initialization
- Frontend: Basic layout and navigation working
- Docker: Services configured but not yet tested
- Database: Schema ready but needs initial migration/seeding

## Next Steps
1. Test Docker setup and database initialization
2. Add basic API endpoints testing
3. Implement member CRUD operations in frontend
4. Add form handling and validation
5. Create initial data seeding scripts

## Architecture Decisions Made
- Node.js + TypeScript backend with Express
- React + TypeScript frontend with Vite
- SQLite with better-sqlite3 for database
- Redis for webhook queue processing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Bitfield approach for boolean flags in database

## MVP Focus
Keeping scope minimal with:
- Member management (core CRUD)
- Basic event tracking
- External system integration tracking
- Webhook handling foundation

Post-MVP features commented out:
- Facilities management
- Grievance system  
- Advanced runbooks/checklists
- Audit logging
