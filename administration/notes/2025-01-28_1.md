# Implementation Plan - 2025-01-28

## Current System Status ✅
Based on previous notes, we have:
- ✅ Full backend API with Express + TypeScript
- ✅ React frontend with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ SQLite database with proper schema 
- ✅ Docker setup with compose
- ✅ Testing framework (Playwright)
- ✅ 6/8 tests passing (minor UI selector issues to fix)

## Implementation Goals
The system foundation is solid. Focus on building out the member management interface and connecting frontend to backend.

## Today's Priorities
1. **Verify Current Setup**: Test Docker and services are running correctly
2. **Member CRUD Interface**: Build comprehensive member management UI
3. **API Integration**: Connect forms to backend endpoints
4. **Form Validation**: Add proper client-side validation
5. **Testing**: Fix failing tests and add new ones

## Architecture Decisions to Maintain
- Keep using bitfields instead of booleans (per CLAUDE.md)
- SQLite database inspection when needed
- Incremental git commits for logical progress
- Test-driven development where it shortens feedback loops

## Key Files to Work With
- `client/src/components/MemberForm.tsx` - Main form component
- `client/src/pages/Members.tsx` - Member list and management
- `client/src/services/memberService.ts` - API client
- `server/src/routes/memberRoutes.ts` - Backend API
- `server/src/services/MemberService.ts` - Business logic

## Success Criteria
- Members can be created, read, updated, deleted via UI
- Form validation prevents invalid data submission  
- API integration works smoothly
- Tests pass consistently
- Code committed incrementally with clear messages
