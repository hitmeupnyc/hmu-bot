# Development Experience Audit - July 29, 2025

## Current Pain Points & Gotchas

### üî• Critical Issues

1. **Missing .env Setup Automation**
   - Developers must manually copy `.env.example` to `.env` 
   - No validation that required env vars are set
   - Easy to forget and leads to cryptic startup errors

2. **Database Setup Friction**
   - No automatic migration/seeding on first run
   - `npm run dev` fails if database doesn't exist
   - Developers need to know to run `db:migrate:latest` and `db:seed` manually

3. **Docker Development Issues**
   - Client Dockerfile exposes port 5173 but uses nginx config that serves on port 80
   - Docker client doesn't proxy API requests to server properly
   - No docker-compose.dev.yml for development workflow

4. **Inconsistent Command Patterns**
   - Some commands use `turbo run`, others don't
   - Missing important dev commands like `dev:db-reset`
   - No consolidated "first-time setup" command

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Issues

5. **Poor Error Messages**
   - Database connection errors are cryptic
   - Missing dependency errors don't suggest solutions
   - No health check endpoints for debugging

6. **Testing Workflow Friction**
   - E2E tests require manual server startup
   - No way to run tests against fresh database
   - Test database setup is manual

7. **Development Tooling Gaps**
   - No pre-commit hooks
   - No automatic code formatting on save
   - Missing dev dependency management

### üìã Missing Nice-to-Haves

8. **Developer Experience Enhancements**
   - No `.vscode/settings.json` for consistent editor config
   - No automatic dependency updates checking
   - Missing development shortcuts/aliases
   - No automatic port detection/conflict resolution

## Root Cause Analysis

Most issues stem from:
- **Lack of automation** in setup processes
- **Missing validation** of environment state
- **Inconsistent command patterns** across the monorepo
- **Docker configs optimized for production**, not development

## Impact Assessment

- **New developer onboarding**: 30-60 mins of friction
- **Daily development**: 5-10 mins lost to manual tasks
- **Context switching**: High cognitive load to remember commands
- **Debugging time**: Significantly increased due to poor error messages
