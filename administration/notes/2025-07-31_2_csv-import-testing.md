# CSV Import Testing Guide

## Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented a complete CSV import flow for applications with the following components:

### 1. Frontend (CsvImport Component)
- File upload with CSV validation
- CSV parsing and validation preview
- Error reporting with row-level details
- Template download functionality
- Real-time validation feedback

### 2. Backend (Bulk Import Endpoint)
- `/api/applications/bulk` endpoint
- Batch processing with error handling
- Partial success handling (207 Multi-Status)
- Detailed error reporting per row
- Full application data preservation in sponsor_notes

### 3. Integration
- Added to Members page with toggle visibility
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- React Query integration for automatic data refresh

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Manual Testing
1. Navigate to `/members` page
2. Click "Import CSV" button
3. Download template to see expected format
4. Test with valid CSV file
5. Test with invalid data to verify error handling

### 2. CSV Template Format
```csv
name,pronouns,preferred_name,email,social_url_primary,social_url_secondary,social_url_tertiary,birth_year,referral_source,sponsor_name,sponsor_email_confirmation,referral_details,kinky_experience,self_description,consent_understanding,additional_info,consent_policy_agreement
John Doe,he/him,Johnny,john@example.com,https://fetlife.com/users/johndoe,,,1990,Fetlife,Jane Smith,true,,I have been to a few events...,I am a friendly person who...,Consent means ongoing communication...,No additional information,yes
```

### 3. Database Changes
The imported applications are stored as Members with:
- Parsed name fields (first_name, last_name, preferred_name)
- All application details preserved in sponsor_notes
- CSV Import prefix for tracking
- Professional affiliate flag set to false

### 4. Rollback Instructions
If needed, CSV imports can be identified by:
```sql
SELECT * FROM members WHERE sponsor_notes LIKE 'CSV Import -%';
```
To remove CSV imports:
```sql
DELETE FROM members WHERE sponsor_notes LIKE 'CSV Import -%';
```
