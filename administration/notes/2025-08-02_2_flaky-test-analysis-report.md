# E2E Test Flakiness Analysis Report

*Date: 2025-08-02*
*Analysis based on 4 test runs with 1500ms timeout*

## Consistently Failing Tests

### 1. Events Management System Tests
**Files:** `events-management.spec.ts`

#### Failing Tests:
- `should display events list page` (100% failure rate)
- `should edit event successfully from events list` (100% failure rate) 
- `should edit event successfully from event details page` (100% failure rate)
- `should handle edit event form validation` (75% failure rate)
- `should edit multiple event fields successfully` (75% failure rate)

#### Root Causes:

**A. Missing Button Issue:**
- Error: `getByRole('button', { name: 'Create Event' })` not found
- Indicates the Events page is not fully loading or React components aren't mounting properly

**B. Test Data Contamination:**
- Expected event name: "Club Management" (from seed data)
- Actual event name: "E2E Test Event [timestamp]" (from previous test)
- Tests are contaminating each other's data despite database reset

**C. Timing Issues:**
- Tests expect seed data but find test-created data
- Database reset occurs globally, but test data persists across tests

### 2. Member CRUD Tests
**Files:** `member-crud.spec.ts`

#### Failing Tests:
- `should submit public application form` (100% failure rate)
- `should create a new member through the UI` (75% failure rate)
- `should search for members` (75% failure rate)

#### Root Causes:

**A. Hardcoded Timeouts:**
- `await page.waitForTimeout(2000)` fails with 1500ms test timeout
- Poor practice using fixed waits instead of waiting for specific conditions

**B. Missing UI Elements:**
- `getByRole('button', { name: 'Add Member' })` not found
- Members page not loading correctly
- `tbody tr` elements not found (empty table)

**C. Form Submission Issues:**
- Application submission not completing within timeout
- No success message appearing

## Patterns Identified

### 1. **Database State Contamination**
- Global database reset doesn't isolate test data properly
- Tests create data that affects subsequent tests
- Seed data expectations vs. test-created data mismatch

### 2. **Page Loading Race Conditions**
- React components not fully mounting before tests interact with them
- Missing proper waits for page/component readiness
- Timeout issues with async operations

### 3. **Poor Test Isolation**
- Tests depend on specific database state (seed data)
- Tests modify state that affects other tests
- No cleanup between tests

### 4. **Hardcoded Waits vs. Smart Waits**
- Using `waitForTimeout()` instead of waiting for specific conditions
- Timeout values exceed test timeout limits
- No proper waiting for async operations to complete

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. **Immediate Fixes (High Priority)**

**A. Fix Hardcoded Timeouts**
- Replace `page.waitForTimeout(2000)` with conditional waits
- Use `waitForResponse()` or `waitForSelector()` instead
- Remove waits that exceed test timeout

**B. Add Proper Page Load Waits**
- Wait for specific elements to be visible before interactions
- Add `waitForLoadState('networkidle')` after navigation
- Wait for React Query/API calls to complete

### 2. **Test Data Management (Medium Priority)**

**A. Better Test Isolation**
- Reset database state between test files, not just globally
- Clear test-created data after each test
- Use transactions that can be rolled back

**B. Fix Data Expectations**
- Don't hardcode expectations for seed data names
- Use dynamic selectors based on actual data
- Create test data within tests instead of relying on seeds

### 3. **Robust Element Selection (Medium Priority)**

**A. Better Selectors**
- Add `data-testid` attributes to key UI elements
- Use more specific selectors that don't rely on text content
- Add retry logic for element interactions

**B. Component Loading Waits**
- Wait for React components to fully mount
- Check for loading states and wait for completion
- Add proper error boundary handling

### 4. **Configuration Improvements (Low Priority)**

**A. Timeout Management**
- Increase test timeout back to reasonable level (5000ms)
- Add per-test timeout overrides for slow operations
- Configure separate timeouts for different operation types

**B. Better Error Reporting**
- Add custom error messages for common failures
- Include page state debugging in failed tests
- Add network request logging for API failures

## Priority Order for Implementation

1. **Fix hardcoded timeouts in member-crud.spec.ts** - Immediate
2. **Add proper page load waits to all tests** - Immediate  
3. **Fix data contamination in events tests** - High
4. **Improve element selection strategies** - Medium
5. **Implement better test isolation** - Medium

## Expected Impact

- **Quick wins:** Fixing timeouts should resolve 4-5 failing tests immediately
- **Major improvement:** Proper page load waits should resolve most UI element not found issues
- **Long-term stability:** Test isolation will prevent data contamination issues

## Test Environment Issues

- Database reset strategy is too coarse-grained
- React app loading not properly synchronized with test execution
- API response times may be variable causing timing issues
