# E2E Test Results Analysis - 2025-08-03

## Test Run Summary

**Total Tests:** 82
- ✅ **Passed:** 27
- ❌ **Failed:** 49
- ⏭️ **Skipped:** 6

## Analysis by Test Suite

### Passing Tests ✅

1. **API Tests** (4/4) - All passing
   - Basic health check, member/event lists, 404 handling

2. **Basic Navigation** (4/4) - All passing
   - Homepage, navigation between sections

3. **CSV Import** (5/5) - All passing
   - Header mapping, drag & drop functionality

4. **Some Error Handling** (1/7) - Network error test passing

### Failing Tests ❌

The 1500ms timeout is successfully identifying tests that need better wait strategies:

1. **Dashboard Tests** (7/10 failed)
   - Statistics display
   - Member breakdown
   - Upcoming events
   - Loading states
   - Most failures are due to timing issues with data loading

2. **Settings Page** (9/10 failed)
   - Email template operations
   - Integration modals
   - All failures appear to be timing-related

3. **Member Details** (12/12 failed)
   - All member detail operations failing
   - Likely due to navigation and data loading timing

4. **Event Features** (12/12 failed)
   - Marketing content
   - Volunteer management
   - Attendance tracking

5. **Events Management** (10/11 failed)
   - Event CRUD operations
   - Tab navigation

6. **Error Handling** (6/11 failed)
   - Various error scenarios failing due to timing

## Root Cause Analysis

The aggressive 1500ms timeout is working as intended - it's revealing tests that:

1. **Don't wait for network requests properly**
   - Missing `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`
   - Not waiting for specific API responses

2. **Don't wait for elements correctly**
   - Using `isVisible()` without proper expects
   - Not waiting for data to populate

3. **Have race conditions**
   - Navigation timing issues
   - Modal open/close timing

## Recommendations for Test Fixes

### Priority 1: Add Proper Wait Strategies

```typescript
// Instead of:
await page.goto('/dashboard');

// Use:
await page.goto('/dashboard');
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
```

### Priority 2: Wait for Specific Elements

```typescript
// Instead of:
const value = await element.textContent();

// Use:
await expect(element).toBeVisible();
const value = await element.textContent();
```

### Priority 3: Handle Async Operations

```typescript
// For API operations:
await page.waitForResponse(response => 
  response.url().includes('/api/members') && response.status() === 200
);
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix dashboard tests first (most basic functionality)
2. Update member details tests with proper waits
3. Fix settings page tests
4. Update event-related tests
5. Improve error handling test reliability

The 1500ms timeout is successfully exposing flaky tests that need to be fixed with proper wait conditions rather than relying on timing.
