# Test Progress Update - 2025-08-04

## Progress Summary

**Initial State:** 27/82 tests passing (33%)
**After Fixes:** 28/82 tests passing (34%)
**Timeout:** Increased from 1500ms to 5000ms

## Improvements Made

### Fixed Tests âœ…
1. **Dashboard:** Loading state test now passes
2. **Error Handling:** Several error tests now pass with proper waits

### Remaining Failures

#### Dashboard Tests (6/10 failing)
- Statistics display timing
- Member breakdown visibility
- Upcoming events section
- Update statistics after changes
- Section layout verification
- Empty state handling

#### Settings Page (9/10 failing)
- All template-related operations failing
- Integration modal tests failing

#### Member Details (12/12 failing)
- All member detail operations still failing

#### Event Features (11/12 failing)
- Most event management features failing

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Selector Issues**: Some selectors may not match actual DOM
2. **State Management**: Tests may be interfering with each other
3. **API Timing**: Even with 5000ms, some API calls may need explicit waits

## Next Steps

1. Debug specific selector issues in dashboard tests
2. Add more explicit API response waits
3. Check for test isolation issues
4. Consider using test fixtures for consistent data
