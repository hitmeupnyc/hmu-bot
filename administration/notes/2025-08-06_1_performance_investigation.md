# Performance Investigation: CSV Import Test Timeout

## Summary
The CSV import test was failing with a 1500ms timeout, but investigation shows the test consistently passes when run individually or as part of the CSV Import test suite.

## Key Findings

1. **Page Load Performance**:
   - `/members` page loads consistently in 650-760ms
   - Navigation (with networkidle): ~670ms average
   - DOM elements visible: ~35ms after navigation
   - No API calls are made during initial page load

2. **Test Behavior**:
   - Test passes when run individually
   - Test passes when run with other CSV import tests
   - All 6 CSV import tests complete in 6.9s total
   - The 1500ms timeout is sufficient for the actual page load

3. **Performance Breakdown**:
   - Navigation to /members: ~670ms
   - Members heading visible: +34ms
   - Import CSV button visible: +5ms
   - Total: ~710ms (well under 1500ms)

## Possible Causes of Original Failure

1. **Test Environment State**: The test may have failed due to:
   - Previous test leaving the browser in an unexpected state
   - Resource contention when running full test suite
   - Cold start penalty if it's the first test accessing the server

2. **Transient Issues**:
   - Server temporarily slow to respond
   - Local system resource constraints
   - Browser cache state

## Recommendations

1. The test is correctly written and doesn't need changes
2. The 1500ms timeout is appropriate and working as intended
3. If the test fails again in CI/full suite runs, investigate:
   - Test ordering and isolation
   - Resource cleanup between tests
   - Server warm-up time

## No Performance Issues Found

The `/members` page loads quickly and efficiently with no API calls during initial render, suggesting good performance optimization already in place.
