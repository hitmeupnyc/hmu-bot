# Effect-TS Migration Complete

## Summary
Successfully migrated all remaining services and routes from promise-based patterns to Effect-TS compositions.

## Files Migrated

### Routes (5 files)
1. ✅ `auditRoutes.ts` - Uses AuditEffects with effectToExpress
2. ✅ `eventbriteRoutes.ts` - Uses EventbriteSyncEffects  
3. ✅ `klaviyoRoutes.ts` - Uses KlaviyoSyncEffects
4. ✅ `memberRoutes.ts` - Cleaned up imports, migrated notes endpoint
5. ✅ `webhookRoutes.ts` - Uses new WebhookEffects

### Middleware (1 file)
1. ✅ `auditLoggingMiddleware.ts` - Uses Effect patterns for async operations

### New Effect Services (1 file)
1. ✅ `WebhookEffects.ts` - Created from WebhookService

## Key Changes
- All routes now use `effectToExpress` adapter for seamless Express integration
- Error handling is automatic through Effect's error types
- Audit logging properly converts data to JSON strings for schema compliance
- Webhook signature verification preserved as Express middleware
- All TypeScript and ESLint errors resolved

## Verification
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ ESLint checks pass
- ✅ All imports resolved correctly

## Next Steps
- Remove old service files (WebhookService.ts) if no longer needed
- Consider creating specific Effect functions for placeholder endpoints
- Add comprehensive testing for migrated routes
