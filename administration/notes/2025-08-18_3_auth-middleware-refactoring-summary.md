# Auth Middleware Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the Express authentication middleware to follow Effect-TS best practices and patterns from the decision guide.

## What Was Refactored

### Before: Mixed Paradigms
- Promise-based async/await mixed with Effect calls
- Generic error handling with try/catch blocks
- Direct service instantiation in middleware
- No structured error types
- No observability or resilience patterns

### After: Pure Effect Architecture

#### 1. **AuthService Interface** (`AuthService.ts`)
- Type-safe service contract with proper error types
- Structured error classes with discriminated unions:
  - `AuthenticationError` - session validation failures
  - `AuthorizationError` - permission/flag check failures
  - `SessionValidationError` - validation schema errors
- Configuration schema with defaults
- Clean separation of concerns

#### 2. **AuthServiceLive Implementation** (`AuthServiceLive.ts`)
- Effect-based implementation with dependency injection
- Integration with existing AuthorizationService and FlagService
- Retry policies with exponential backoff
- Timeout protection for external auth calls
- HMU domain bypass logic moved to service layer
- Comprehensive error mapping

#### 3. **Middleware Adapter** (`middlewareAdapter.ts`)
- Generic Effect-to-Express bridge with type safety
- Structured error response mapping
- Built-in observability (metrics, spans, logging)
- Configurable retry policies and timeouts
- Automatic resource cleanup

#### 4. **Layer Composition** (`AuthLayer.ts`)
- Proper dependency wiring
- Reusable layer for middleware integration

#### 5. **Refactored Middleware** (`auth.ts`)
- `requireAuth`: Uses Effect service with proper error handling
- `optionalAuth`: Safe session attachment without failures
- `requirePermission`: Type-safe permission checking with structured errors
- `requireResourcePermission`: Resource-specific permissions with flag checking
- `requireSuperuser`: Simple email-based check (unchanged)
- Convenience functions: `requireVerified`, `requireVolunteer`, etc.

## Key Improvements

### âœ… **Type Safety**
- All operations are type-checked at compile time
- Structured error types with specific failure reasons
- No more generic `Error` objects

### âœ… **Error Handling**
- Replaced generic `catch` blocks with `Effect.catchTags`
- Specific error recovery strategies per error type
- Proper error propagation through Effect chains

### âœ… **Observability**
- Automatic request/response metrics
- Distributed tracing with spans
- Structured logging with context
- Performance monitoring (duration, success/failure rates)

### âœ… **Resilience**
- Exponential backoff retry policies
- Timeout protection for external calls
- Circuit breaker patterns ready for integration
- Graceful degradation for optional features

### âœ… **Service Architecture**
- Dependency injection instead of direct instantiation
- Service contracts with clear interfaces
- Testable architecture with easy mocking
- Layer-based composition for modularity

### âœ… **Resource Management**
- Automatic cleanup through Effect's scope system
- No memory leaks from unhandled promises
- Proper connection pooling integration ready

## Metrics Added

The middleware now automatically tracks:
- `auth_attempts_total` - Total authentication attempts
- `auth_successes_total` - Successful authentications
- `auth_failures_total` - Failed authentications (by error type)
- `auth_duration_ms` - Authentication duration
- `permission_checks_total` - Permission validation attempts
- `permission_denials_total` - Permission denials

## Error Response Format

Structured error responses now include:
```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable message",
  "code": "MACHINE_READABLE_CODE", 
  "reason": "specific_failure_reason",
  "requiredPermission": "permission details",
  "resource": { "type": "resource_type", "id": "resource_id" },
  "missingFlag": "flag_name"
}
```

## Testing Benefits

The new architecture enables:
- Easy unit testing with mock services
- Integration testing with test layers
- Property-based testing with Effect generators
- Deterministic error simulation

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced Promise overhead through Effect's optimized runtime
- Better connection pooling through service layers
- Configurable timeouts prevent hanging requests
- Retry policies reduce transient failure impact

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- Error response format is more structured
- Some convenience middleware names changed (added "Access" suffix)
- Layer dependencies must be provided at application startup

### Backward Compatibility
- Express Request/Response types unchanged
- Session attachment behavior preserved
- Existing route handler signatures work unchanged

## Next Steps

1. **Add Configuration**: Move auth settings to Config module
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Add circuit breaker for auth service calls  
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting with Effect streams
4. **Caching**: Add session caching layer for performance
5. **Monitoring**: Integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure
