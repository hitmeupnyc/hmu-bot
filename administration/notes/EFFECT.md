⏺ Effect-TS Service Implementation Checklist

Each service follows this pattern: Types → Interface → Implementation → Layer → Integration, maintaining functional purity while managing real-world side effects through the Effect system.

1. Define Domain Types & Errors: Create pure TypeScript interfaces for your domain models and custom error classes with _tag discriminators. Keep these in a separate file (e.g., FlagService.ts) for clean separation.
2. Define the service contract as an interface with methods returning Effect.Effect<Success | DifferentSuccess, Error | DifferentError, never>. The never indicates dependencies are resolved internally.
3. Implement Core Business Logic: Write pure functions using Effect.gen(function* () { ... }) that access dependencies via yield*. Keep these functions focused on single responsibilities.
4. Integrate External Services: For third-party APIs, use Effect.tryPromise() to convert promises to Effects, providing structured error handling with your domain errors.
5. Compose Service Layer: Create the live implementation using Layer.effect() that yields dependencies and returns a service record satisfying the interface.
6. Wire Dependencies: Chain layers using .pipe(Layer.provide(...)) to inject required services into your service layer.
7. Implement Error Recovery: Add retry logic with Effect.retry() and timeout policies where appropriate. Use Effect.catchTag() for specific error handling branches.
8. Add Observability: Include structured logging within Effect flows and consider adding spans for tracing. Use Effect.tap() for side effects like logging without affecting the flow.

There are some [best practices](EFFECT_best_practices.md) to consider when using Effect-TS. Use this document when you're planning change to existing Effects, or designing something new.
