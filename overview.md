# HMU automation

## Current System Overview

The organization consists of a small team (approximately 6 staff members) managing a venue that hosts various events including parties, social mixers, classes, workshops, and volunteer efforts. The current processes are largely manual, relying on:

- Instagram for social media marketing
- Eventbrite for ticketing
- Email newsletters for member communications
- Telegram for coordination
- Discord server
- Patreon for membership benefits
- Website (infrequently updated)

## Primary User Requirements

The highest priority functionality appears to be attendee and membership management, specifically:

1. **Membership Vetting System**

   - Two-tier membership structure: Vetted and Private
   - Application process with questionnaire and social media verification
   - Sponsorship tracking for Private membership
   - Tracking of infractions and contributions

2. **Banned Member Management**

   - Documentation of banned individuals
   - Notification system to relevant third parties
   - Community safety protocols

3. **Event Attendance**
   - Ticket sales (potentially replacing or integrating with Eventbrite)
   - Check-in procedures
   - Volunteer attendance tracking

## Secondary Considerations

While not immediate priorities, these aspects may need to be addressed in future iterations:

- Event scheduling and calendar management
- Resource allocation and venue management
- Independent contractor agreements and revenue splitting
- Integration with the website and other platforms
- Volunteer certification tracking

## Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders include:

- Event coordinator and venue management
- Staff members across various functions
- Volunteers
- Event attendees (Vetted and Private members)
- Independent contractors
- Third-party organizations (for banned member information sharing)

## Follow-up Questions

For a more comprehensive understanding, additional information would be helpful on:

1. What specific information is tracked about each event? How is this documented and shared?
2. What volunteer certification information needs to be maintained?
3. What are the specific details needed for independent contractor agreements?
4. What are the current pain points in the manual attendance and membership verification process?
5. Are there any reporting requirements for the organization (financial, attendance, membership growth, etc.)?
6. What security and privacy requirements should be considered for member data?
7. What is the technical expertise level of the staff who will be using this system?

## Recommended Approach

Based on the information provided, I recommend developing a focused solution that:

1. Creates a centralized membership database with vetting status tracking
2. Implements an efficient check-in system for events
3. Provides a simple method for recording and communicating banned individuals
4. Potentially replaces or integrates with Eventbrite for ticketing

The system should be designed with cost-effectiveness and simplicity in mind, leveraging existing tools where possible while providing a more streamlined workflow for the core functions of membership and attendance management.
